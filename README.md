Code Quiz



## Description 


This Code Quiz project showcases my skills in the use of JavaScript fundamentals implemented in the creation of a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. It stores high scores so that users can gauge their progress compared to their peers. It works as a start button is clicked, then a timer starts and the first question appears, questions contain buttons for each answer and when an answer is clicked, the next question appears, if the answer clicked is incorrect then time will be subtracted from the clock. The quiz will end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. Finally when the game ends, it displays users score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score.
